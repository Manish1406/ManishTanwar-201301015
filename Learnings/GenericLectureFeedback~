I like the way teaching in

Week1,2and 3

#1 I liked Candy Crush disccusion
#2 I would like to see more of programming-related content but there is so many thing which we are not familiar about like use- diagram, factory and others that I want to learn conceptually.
#3 I loved the interactive style of teaching and also comic way of teaching.
