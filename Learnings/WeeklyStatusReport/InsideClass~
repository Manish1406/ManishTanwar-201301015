xHey good start... but posters must convey a message.. look at the different sections... in the poster I shared? what is the problem? what are the existing solutions? What is the proposed solution? How does it work? What is the future work?

Now think of what we have done in the class? What are the activities that we have done? What are the fundamentals that you have learnt... also make the title of the poster to the title of the lecture notes...
