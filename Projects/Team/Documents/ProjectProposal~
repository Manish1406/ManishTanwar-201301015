1. Project Idea: Multi-utility Simulator

2. Overview: 
   		Hosting a web application that enables engineering students to enhance their skills and showcase it to the outside world.The 			Web application would mainly have problems and projects proposed by companies and the users could code,debug and then submit 			their code (for CSE field), Similarly for ECE students there would be a simulator engine where they could pick and drop 		objects like gates,op-amps.. and design their circuit and then submit their solution for the proposals posted on the 			website..Similarly for Civil engineers they can design their model using the pick and drop tools in a 2D form and it would 			give a 3D output of their model which could be posted..!!This could help students in getting along with the organizations and 			help them code fast and easier!

3. Common fields: 
		Every person would have to sign up and choose his area of interest. Only a registered person can post his solutions.

4.Testing and verify:-
			under process.....

5. Techniques require:-
		
		We would be using platforms such as java,c++,JS, some animation and gaming tools.(Still have to figure it out well).

User satisfaction and delieverable:-
					ideas in progress.......
